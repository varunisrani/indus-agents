# ✅ TodoWrite Tool Successfully Added!

## Summary

The **TodoWrite tool** from Agency-Code has been successfully integrated into your indus-agents framework! 🎉

---

## What Was Added

### 1. **TodoWrite Tool** (`src/indusagi/tools/dev/todo_write.py`)

A complete task management tool that helps agents:
- Create structured todo lists
- Track task progress (pending → in_progress → completed)
- Set priorities (high/medium/low)
- Enforce only ONE task in_progress at a time
- Display organized task status

### 2. **Updated BaseTool Schema Generator** (`src/indusagi/tools/base.py`)

Enhanced the `get_schema()` method to:
- Handle complex nested types (arrays with items)
- Support Pydantic model references
- Properly resolve enum types
- Generate valid OpenAI function calling schemas

### 3. **Updated Agent Prompts** (`example_agency.py`)

Both Planner and Coder agents now have **CRITICAL: TASK MANAGEMENT WITH TODOWRITE** sections that instruct them to:
- Use `todo_write` BEFORE starting any complex task (3+ steps)
- Break down requests into specific, actionable todos
- Mark tasks as in_progress when working
- Mark tasks as completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing
- Keep only ONE task in_progress at a time

### 4. **Tool Registration** (`example_agency.py`)

TodoWrite is now registered with the agency alongside other tools:
```python
for tool_class in [Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, TodoWrite]:
    registry.register(tool_class)
```

## Test Results

```
Creating development agency...
[SUCCESS] Agency created: DevAgency
[SUCCESS] Tools registered: 8
Tool names: ['bash', 'read', 'edit', 'write', 'glob', 'grep', 'todo_write', 'handoff_to_agent']
[SUCCESS] todo_write tool is registered!

Task: Create a portfolio website
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Coder] Using tool: todo_write with args: {
  'todos': [
    {'task': 'Create project folder portfolio_website/', 'status': 'pending', 'priority': 'high'},
    {'task': 'Create index.html with Home, About, and Contact sections', 'status': 'pending', 'priority': 'high'},
    {'task': 'Create styles.css with responsive design', 'status': 'pending', 'priority': 'medium'},
    {'task': 'Create app.js for any interactive elements', 'status': 'pending', 'priority': 'medium'},
    {'task': 'Add navigation bar to index.html', 'status': 'pending', 'priority': 'high'},
    {'task': 'Add contact form to Contact section in index.html', 'status': 'pending', 'priority': 'high'},
    {'task': 'Test the website for responsiveness and functionality', 'status': 'pending', 'priority': 'low'}
  ]
}

[Coder] Using tool: todo_write with args: {
  'todos': [
    {'task': 'Create project folder portfolio_website/', 'status': 'in_progress', 'priority': 'high'},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**✅ TodoWrite is working perfectly!**

The agent:
1. **Created 7 todos** when given a complex task
2. **Marked the first task as in_progress** before starting work
3. **Organized tasks by priority** (high/medium/low)
4. **Followed the workflow** exactly as instructed

---

## How It Works

### Workflow

```
User Request: "Create a portfolio website"
    ↓
Agent receives task
    ↓
Agent uses todo_write to create task list:
  1. Create project folder - PENDING, HIGH
  2. Create index.html - PENDING, HIGH
  3. Create styles.css - PENDING, MEDIUM
  4. Create app.js - PENDING, MEDIUM
  5. Add navigation - PENDING, HIGH
  6. Add contact form - PENDING, HIGH
  7. Test website - PENDING, LOW
    ↓
Agent marks task 1 as IN_PROGRESS
    ↓
Agent works on task 1
    ↓
Agent marks task 1 as COMPLETED
    ↓
Agent marks task 2 as IN_PROGRESS
    ↓
... continues until all done
```

### TodoWrite Output Example

```
Todo List Updated (2026-01-02 23:15:42)
Summary: total=7, done=2, in_progress=1, pending=4

IN PROGRESS:
  [HIGH] Create index.html with Home, About, and Contact sections

PENDING:
  [MEDIUM] Create styles.css with responsive design
  [MEDIUM] Create app.js for any interactive elements
  [HIGH] Add navigation bar to index.html
  [LOW] Test the website for responsiveness and functionality

COMPLETED (showing last 2):
  [HIGH] Create project folder portfolio_website/
  [HIGH] Add contact form to Contact section in index.html

Tips:
  - Keep only ONE task 'in_progress' at a time
  - Mark tasks 'completed' immediately after finishing
  - Break complex tasks into smaller, actionable steps
```

## When Agents Use TodoWrite

### ✅ Agents WILL use TodoWrite for:

1. **Complex multi-step tasks** (3+ steps)
   - "Create a web app"
   - "Build a REST API"
   - "Implement user authentication"

2. **User provides multiple tasks**
   - "Create index.html, styles.css, and app.js"
   - "Add these features: login, signup, dashboard"

3. **Non-trivial complex tasks**
   - "Refactor the authentication module"
   - "Optimize database queries"

### ❌ Agents will NOT use TodoWrite for:

1. **Single straightforward tasks**
   - "Fix this typo"
   - "Read README.md"

2. **Trivial tasks** (< 3 steps)
   - "Create a hello.txt file"
   - "List all Python files"

3. **Conversational requests**
   - "What does this function do?"
   - "Explain the architecture"
