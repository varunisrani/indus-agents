# Handoff Loop Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The Planner agent's logs were not showing because the **Agency wasn't continuing processing after handoffs**.

### What Was Happening:

```
User → Coder
  ↓
Coder calls handoff_to_agent("Planner", "Create plan.md")
  ↓
Tool returns "Handoff scheduled"
  ↓
Coder responds: "I've handed off to Planner..."
  ↓
❌ STOPS HERE - Planner never executes!
```

### Root Cause:

1. `Agency.process()` only processed the entry agent once
2. After the first agent responded, it returned immediately
3. Handoffs were registered but never executed
4. No loop to continue processing with target agents

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `Agency.process()` (agency.py:212-299)

Added a **processing loop** that:
- Continues until no more handoffs occur
- Detects pending handoffs via `registry._pending_handoff`
- Switches to target agent and processes again
- Respects `max_handoffs` limit
- Shows handoff progress with emoji indicators

### 2. Updated `handoff_to_agent` tool (handoff.py:29-66)

Changed from **immediate execution** to **deferred execution**:
- Sets `registry._pending_handoff` with handoff details
- Returns confirmation message
- Agency loop detects and executes the handoff

### 3. Flow Now Works Correctly:

```
User → Coder
  ↓
Coder processes & calls handoff_to_agent("Planner", "Create plan.md")
  ↓
handoff_to_agent sets registry._pending_handoff
  ↓
Agency.process() detects pending handoff
  ↓
🔄 Shows: "[Coder] → Handing off to [Planner]..."
  ↓
Planner receives message
  ↓
Planner processes (uses Write tool, creates plan.md, etc.)
  ↓
✅ Planner's logs show!
  ↓
If Planner calls handoff_to_agent("Coder", "Implement plan")
  ↓
Loop continues...
  ↓
Coder receives handoff
  ↓
Coder processes (reads plan.md, implements, etc.)
  ↓
✅ All agent logs visible!
```

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Run Test Script

```bash
python test_handoff_fix.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ SUCCESS: Handoff loop working!
   Flow: Coder → Planner → Coder
```

### Option 2: Interactive Demo

```bash
python example_agency_improved.py
```

Then try:
```
You: Create plan.md for a todo app, then implement it
```

Expected behavior:
```
[Coder] Analyzing request...
[Coder] Calling handoff_to_agent...

🔄 [Coder] → Handing off to [Planner]...

[Planner] Received handoff from Coder
[Planner] Creating plan.md...
[Planner] Using Write tool...
📊 TOOL USAGE: ✅ write (plan.md created)
[Planner] Handing off back to Coder...

🔄 [Planner] → Handing off to [Coder]...

[Coder] Received handoff from Planner
[Coder] Reading plan.md...
📊 TOOL USAGE: ✅ read
[Coder] Creating todo list...
📊 TOOL USAGE: ✅ todo_write
[Coder] Creating folder...
📊 TOOL USAGE: ✅ bash (mkdir)
[Coder] Creating files...
📊 TOOL USAGE: ✅ write (index.html, styles.css, app.js)

[Coder]: Todo app created successfully!

  (Handoffs: 2, Time: 15.3s)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Visible Agent Activity
- All agent processing is now visible
- Tool usage logs show for ALL agents (not just entry agent)
- Handoff transitions are clearly marked with 🔄

### 2. Proper Multi-Agent Coordination
- Agents can handoff back and forth
- Each agent's turn is fully executed
- Conversation context flows through handoffs

### 3. Handoff Tracking
- `AgencyResponse.agents_used` shows full agent sequence
- Example: `["Coder", "Planner", "Coder"]`
- Handoff count prevents infinite loops

## Example Usage

### Simple Planning Request

```python
You: "Use Planner to create plan.md for a weather app"
```

Flow:
```
Coder → Planner (creates plan.md) → Coder (asks if should implement)
```

Agents used: `["Coder", "Planner", "Coder"]`

### Automatic Planning Detection

```python
You: "Build a complex e-commerce site with user auth and payments"
```

Flow:
```
Coder (detects complexity) → Planner (creates strategic plan) → Coder (implements)
```

Agents used: `["Coder", "Planner", "Coder"]`

### Simple Task (No Handoff)

```python
You: "Create a hello world HTML page"
```

Flow:
```
Coder (handles directly, no handoff needed)
```

Agents used: `["Coder"]`

## Verification Checklist

After running the improved agency, verify:

- [ ] Planner's tool usage shows in logs (Write, Read, etc.)
- [ ] Handoff messages appear: `🔄 [Agent1] → Handing off to [Agent2]...`
- [ ] Both agents' responses are visible
- [ ] `/logs` command shows tools from ALL agents
- [ ] `plan.md` file is actually created when requested
- [ ] Coder reads `plan.md` and implements it

## Files Modified

1. **src/indusagi/agency.py** (line 212-299)
   - Added processing loop in `process()` method
   - Added handoff detection and continuation logic

2. **src/indusagi/tools/handoff.py** (line 29-66)
   - Changed to deferred handoff execution
   - Sets `_pending_handoff` instead of immediate execution

3. **example_agency_improved.py** (NEW)
   - Improved agency with better instructions
   - Clear handoff criteria based on Agency-Code

4. **test_handoff_fix.py** (NEW)
   - Automated test to verify handoff loop works

## Debug Commands

During interactive demo:

- `/agents` - List all agents
- `/handoffs` - Show communication flows
- `/logs` - View recent tool usage (from ALL agents)
- `/stats` - Show tool usage statistics
- `/export` - Export complete logs to JSON

## Next Steps

1. Run `python example_agency_improved.py`
2. Test with: `"Create plan.md for a calculator, then build it"`
3. Verify Planner logs appear
4. Verify plan.md is created
5. Verify Coder reads and implements plan

The handoff loop fix ensures multi-agent coordination works as designed! 🎉
