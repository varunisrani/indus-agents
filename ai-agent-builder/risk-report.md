## Conclusion

The AI Agent Builder project has **3 CRITICAL risks** that must be addressed before production launch:

1. **Security architecture** needs server-side components
2. **Scalability** requires hybrid execution model  
3. **API dependency management** needs abstraction layer

Recommended approach: **Start with MVP focused on core functionality**, implement proper security from day one, and plan for server-side execution engine in Phase 2.

**Risk-adjusted timeline:** Original 4 weeks → **6-8 weeks** with proper risk mitigation.
