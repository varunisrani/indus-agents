# 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

## Summary

Multiple critical issues have been fixed to make the agency work correctly with one-by-one task execution, proper Windows compatibility, and clear error messaging.

---

## Fix #1: ✅ Full Todo Progress Tracking

### Problem:
- Todo list only showed changes, not full progress
- Hard to track what's done vs what's left
- No visual status indicators

### Solution:
Updated `src/indusagi/agent.py` to show full todo list on every update with visual indicators:

```
======================================================================
[Coder] TODO LIST UPDATE:
======================================================================
  1. [!] ✅ Create folder game_website          ← Completed
  2. [!] 🔄 Create game_website/index.html      ← In Progress
  3. [~] ⏳ Create game_website/styles.css      ← Pending
  4. [~] ⏳ Create game_website/app.js
  5. [-] ⏳ Test the game website

Progress: 1 done, 1 in progress, 3 pending
======================================================================
```

**Status Indicators:**
- ⏳ = Pending
- 🔄 = In Progress
- ✅ = Completed

**Priority Indicators:**
- `[!]` = HIGH
- `[~]` = MEDIUM
- `[-]` = LOW

---

## Fix #2: ✅ One-by-One Task Execution Enforcement

### Problem:
- Agent was executing multiple tasks simultaneously
- Todos weren't updated between tasks
- Progress tracking was confusing

### Solution:
Added code-level enforcement in `agent.py` to prevent multiple tool calls when todos are active:

```python
# Check if there are active todos
todos = self.context.get("todos", []) if self.context else []
has_active_todos = any(
    todo.get("status") in ["pending", "in_progress"]
    for todo in todos
)

# If multiple non-todo tools called, enforce one-by-one
if has_active_todos and len(non_todo_calls) > 1:
    print(f"⚠️ WARNING: Attempted to execute {len(non_todo_calls)} tools at once!")
    print(f"Enforcing ONE-BY-ONE execution")
    # Filter to only first non-todo_write call
```

Now the agent MUST:
1. Mark ONE task as in_progress
2. Execute that task
3. Mark it completed
4. Then move to next task

---

## Fix #3: ✅ Windows Compatibility for Bash Tool

### Problem:
```
Error executing command: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
```

The Bash tool was trying to use `/bin/bash` which doesn't exist on Windows.

### Solution:
Updated `src/indusagi/tools/dev/bash.py` to detect platform and use appropriate shell:

```python
# Platform-specific shell command
if sys.platform == "win32":
    # Windows: use cmd.exe
    shell_cmd = ["cmd.exe", "/c", self.command]
else:
    # Unix/Linux/Mac: use bash
    shell_cmd = ["/bin/bash", "-c", self.command]
```

Now the Bash tool works on:
- ✅ Windows (cmd.exe)
- ✅ Linux (bash)
- ✅ macOS (bash)

---

## Fix #4: ✅ Bash Command Validation

### Problem:
Agent was using task descriptions like "Create project folder" as bash commands instead of actual commands like "mkdir game_website"

### Solution:
Added validation in `bash.py` to detect and reject description-like commands:

```python
if command_lower.startswith("create project folder") or command_lower.startswith("create folder"):
    # Extract folder name if present
    folder_name = parts[-1].strip()
    return (
        f"❌ ERROR: Invalid bash command!\n\n"
        f"You used: '{self.command}'\n"
        f"This is a DESCRIPTION, not a bash command!\n\n"
        f"✅ CORRECT command: mkdir {folder_name}\n\n"
        f"Please use the actual bash command 'mkdir' to create folders."
    )
```

Now when agent tries wrong commands, it gets clear error messages teaching it the correct syntax.

---

## Fix #5: ✅ Improved Bash Error Logging

### Problem:
- Couldn't see the actual bash command being executed
- Only saw the description
- Hard to debug what went wrong

### Solution:
Updated `agent.py` to show BOTH command and description:

**Before:**
```
[Coder] Running: Create project folder
```

**After:**
```
[Coder] Running bash: 'mkdir game_website'
[Coder] Description: Create project folder
```

Now you can see exactly what command is being executed!

---

## Fix #6: ✅ Bash Error Display

### Problem:
- Bash errors weren't being shown
- Agent would silently fail

### Solution:
Updated `agent.py` to display bash errors prominently:

```python
if tool_name == "bash":
    if "❌ ERROR" in result or "Error" in result:
        print(f"\n{'='*70}")
        print(f"[{self.name}] BASH ERROR:")
        print(f"{'='*70}")
        print(result)
        print(f"{'='*70}\n")
```

Now bash errors are clearly visible and include helpful guidance.

---

## Fix #7: ✅ Shared Context Between Agent and Tools

### Problem:
```
AttributeError: 'ToolRegistry' object has no attribute 'context'
```

The agent couldn't access the tool context to check todo status.

### Solution:

1. Added `context` to `ToolRegistry`:
```python
class ToolRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self._tools: Dict[str, type[BaseTool]] = {}
        self.context = get_tool_context()  # Shared context
```

2. Added `context` parameter to `Agent.__init__()`:
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    name: str,
    role: str,
    config: Optional[AgentConfig] = None,
    system_prompt: Optional[str] = None,
    context: Optional[Any] = None,  # NEW!
):
    self.context = context
```

3. Updated `example_agency.py` to share context:
```python
# Register tools first
for tool_class in [Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, TodoWrite]:
    registry.register(tool_class)

# Create agents with shared context
planner = create_planner_agent(...)
planner.context = registry.context

coder = create_coder_agent(...)
coder.context = registry.context
```

Now agents can check todo status and enforce one-by-one execution!

## Fix #8: ✅ Increased Max Processing Turns

### Problem:
```
I've reached the maximum number of processing steps. The task may be too complex...
```

Agent was hitting the 10-turn limit before completing tasks.

### Solution:
Increased default `max_turns` from 10 to 30 in `agent.py`:

```python
def process_with_tools(
    self,
    user_input: str,
    tools: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
    tool_executor: Optional[Any] = None,
    max_turns: int = 30  # Increased from 10
) -> str:
```

Now complex multi-step tasks can complete without hitting the limit.
